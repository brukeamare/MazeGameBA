	/**
	 * Adds a distance sensor to the robot such that it measures in the given direction.
	 * This method is used when a robot is initially configured to get ready for operation.
	 * The point of view is that one mounts a sensor on the robot such that the robot
	 * can measure distances to obstacles or walls in that particular direction.
	 * For example, if one mounts a sensor in the forward direction, the robot can tell
	 * with the distance to a wall for its current forward direction, more technically,
	 * a method call distanceToObstacle(FORWARD) will return a corresponding distance.
	 * So a robot with a left and forward sensor will internally have 2 DistanceSensor
	 * objects at its disposal to calculate distances, one for the forward, one for the
	 * left direction.
	 * A robot can have at most four sensors in total, and at most one for any direction.
	 * If a robot already has a sensor for the given mounted direction, adding another
	 * sensor will replace/overwrite the current one for that direction with the new one.
