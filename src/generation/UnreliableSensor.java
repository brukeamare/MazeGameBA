	 * Tells the distance to an obstacle (a wallboard) that the sensor

	 * that turns makes it fail and repair for certain amounts of time
	 * The sensor is assumed to be mounted in a particular
	 * direction relative to the forward direction of the robot.
	 * Distance is measured in the number of cells towards that obstacle, 
	 * e.g. 0 if the current cell has a wallboard in this direction, 
	 * 1 if it is one step in this direction before directly facing a wallboard,
	 * Integer.MaxValue if one looks through the exit into eternity.
	 * 
	 * This method requires that the sensor has been given a reference
	 * to the current maze and a mountedDirection by calling 
	 * the corresponding set methods with a parameterized constructor.
	 * 
	 * @param currentPosition is the current location as (x,y) coordinates
	 * @param currentDirection specifies the direction of the robot
	 * @param powersupply is an array of length 1, whose content is modified 
	 * to account for the power consumption for sensing
	 * @return number of steps towards obstacle if obstacle is visible 
	 * in a straight line of sight, Integer.MAX_VALUE otherwise.
	 * @throws Exception with message 
	 * SensorFailure if the sensor is currently not operational
	 * PowerFailure if the power supply is insufficient for the operation
	 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if any parameter is null
	 * or if currentPosition is outside of legal range
